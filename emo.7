.TH emo 7 2015-2-27 "Revision 0.1" "The Emoticon Guide"

.SH
DESCRIPTION

.P
This is a collection of emoticons and emoji commonly used in text-based
communication, particularly via e-mail or IRC. Particular care is taken to
include all common connotations of emoticons, to help the reader decipher
complicated or ambiguous emotions.

INSTALLATION

.P
On UNIX systems, this document can be installed so that it is accessible with
man(1):

.RS
$ cd emo/

$ export MANDIR="..." # defaults to /usr/share/man/

$ sudo make -e install

$ sudo make -e uninstall

BASIC

.P
These emoticons generally consist of two characters. The first, generally a
colon (:) or a semicolon (;) represent a pair of eyes, while the second
represents a mouth.

Note, however, that these might be rewritten using three characters by placing
a hyphen (-) character between the eyes and mouth to represent a nose. By
convention, this reference does not include the nosed versions.

Finally, some smileys are reversible due to the symmetry of the constituent
characters. In such cases, the most commonly-used orientation is listed first.

.IP ":) or (:"
Perhaps the most basic emoticon listed. Conveys happiness, contentment,
gratitude, etc.

.IP ":( or ):"
Conveys sadness, disappointment, and misery.

.IP :P
Indicates that the preceding remark was humerous, sarcastic, or otherwise
lighthearted and not meant to be taken seriously.

.IP :D
Conveys gladness, extreme joy, sudden excitement, etc.

.IP D:
Conveys sudden disappointment, sadness, devastation, etc.

.IP :/
Conveys uncertainty about a situation. Indicates doubt or confusion.

.IP ":O or :o"
Conveys surprise, but not necessarily a positive or negative reaction.

.IP "B) or BD"
Indicates that the speaker feels a certain degree of "coolness" after
having said the preceding remark.

.IP XD
Conveys that the speaker found a recent remark extremely amusing.

.SH
NOTE ON PARENTHESES

.P
The usage of parenthesis-terminated emoticons within parenthsized statements
merits some discussion.  There are several possible conventions which can be
used.

We can optimize for grammatical correctness by placing an additional closing
parenthesis after the emoticon:

.RS
(I like it the way it is. :))
.RE

However, this looks awkward to many. The alternative is to leave off the
trailing parenthesis:

.RS
(I like it the way it is. :)
.RE

This, however, appears incomplete and is not strictly correct. A compromise can
be achieved by placing a space between the two parentheses:

.RS
(I like it the way it is. :) )
.RE

In general, it is left to the writer to choose a style which they prefer.
